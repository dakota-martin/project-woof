	<h2>History Of Pugs</h2>
	<p>The breed named "pug" became popular in the 16th and 17th century. Pugs were popular at European courts, and reportedly become the official dog of the House of Orange in 1572 after a Pug named Pompey saved the life of the Prince of Orange by alerting him to the approach of assassins. Pugs were even beginning to appear in paintings, the oldest painting I could find was a painting in 1795 of William Hogarth and his pug, Trump. Pugs arrived in the United States during the 1900's and were soon making their way into the family home and the show ring. </p>

	<h3>Additional information</h3>
	<p>The breed is often described by the Latin phrase <i>multum in parvo</i>, or "much in little" or "a lot of dog in a small space", alluding to the Pug's remarkable and charming personality, despite its small size. Pugs are strong willed but rarely aggressive, and are suitable for families with children. Pugs tend to be intuitive and sensitive to the moods of their owners and are usually eager to please them. Pugs tend to have a somewhat lazy nature and spend a lot of time napping. Although pugs may have a lazy nature and spend a lot of time napping, their personalitiy hides that feature of them.</p>
